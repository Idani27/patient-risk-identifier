# Patient Risk Identifier Tool

This project is a machine learning-based tool designed to help identify students who may be at risk of mental health challenges or suicidal behavior. It analyzes survey responses related to factors like academic pressure, sleep habits, relationship issues, and emotional well-being.

While the model provides a risk classification, **it is not a diagnostic tool** and **does not replace professional medical or psychological evaluation**.

## 💡 What the Tool Does

- Uses a trained ML model to classify student responses as either **at risk** or **not at risk**
- Built with Python and deployed via a simple frontend (`index.html`)
- Uses a dataset of self-reported student experiences related to:
  -Do you have Depression?	Do you have Anxiety?	Do you have Panic attack?	Did you seek any specialist for a treatment?

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This tool is for educational and research purposes only.**
> It is not clinically validated and should **not** be used as a substitute for licensed mental health care.
> The results generated by the model may contain **bias**, **inaccuracies**, or **false predictions**.
> If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please seek help from a qualified professional.

## 🔧 Limitations & Future Work

- The model is based on a small, self-reported dataset and may not generalize well to broader populations.
- Feature selection and model training were simplified for a proof-of-concept.
- Future improvements could include:
  - More diverse and larger datasets
  - Regular re-training and tuning
  - A secured backend for privacy and ethical compliance
  - Feedback loops or human-in-the-loop moderation
